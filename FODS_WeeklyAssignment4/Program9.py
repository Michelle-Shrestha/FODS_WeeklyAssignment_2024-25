#9. Given the table below,...
# a.	Write a query to select only the Name and Salary columns.
# b.	How would you filter out all employees in the "IT" department?
# c.  Write code to select employees who are older than 30 and find the average salary of employees in each department.
# d.	Write code to count the number of employees in each department.
# e.	Add a new column Bonus which is 10% of each employee's salary.
# f.	Replace all occurrences of "HR" in the Department column with "Human Resources."
# g.	Find the employee(s) with the longest tenure (based on JoinDate).
# h.	Create a new column SalaryCategory where salaries above 75,000 are categorized as "High" and the rest as "Low."
# i.  Write a program to check if there are any duplicate EmployeeIDs and remove them if found.
# j.	Use Pandas to calculate the median Age of all employees.
